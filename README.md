# Introduction:
 In this project, we performed an analysis of sales data to gain insights into various aspects of the business. We used SQL queries to extract, transform,       and analyze the data. The analysis includes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify customer segments and product association analysis to   understand which products are often sold together.

# Data:
 We obtained the sales data set from Kaggle, which includes information such as order number, quantity ordered, price each, sales, order date, status,   quarter ID, month ID, year ID, product line, MSRP, product code, customer name, phone, address, city, state, postal code, country, territory, contact last name, contact first name, and deal size.

# Approach:

* Inspecting Data:
 - Checked the data in the sales table
 - Explored unique values for specific columns

 Analysis:

 - Grouped sales by product line to determine revenue generated by each product line.
 - Grouped sales by year to analyze revenue trends over the years.
 - Analyzed sales by deal size to identify the distribution of sales across different deal sizes.
 - Determined the best month for sales in a specific year and calculated the revenue and frequency for that month.
 - Explored the product line that was sold the most in a specific month.
 - Performed RFM analysis to identify customer segments based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, using logical conditions, subqueries, and nested        subqueries.
 - Analyzed product associations to identify products that are often sold together, using subqueries and the INTO statement for result storage.

 Extras:

  Identified the city with the highest number of sales in a specific country using logical conditions and aggregation functions.
  Determined the best product in the United States based on sales using logical conditions and nested subqueries.

 SQL Functions Used:
- Aggregation functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG
- Window functions: NTILE
- String manipulation functions: STUFF
- Date functions: DATEDIFF
- Conditional expressions: CASE statement
- Common Table Expressions (CTE) with WITH clause
- Subqueries and nested subqueries
- Logical conditions
- Data Query Language (DQL) statements
- INTO statement for result storage
